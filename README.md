# Algorithm-Analysis
These are programs that I wrote for my analysis of algorithms class. It includes mergesort functions, insert sort functions, mergesort into thirds, and a algorithm for the knapsack problem.

### Knapsack: Dynamic Programming and Recursion
The knapsack assignment focused on the time and outcome difference between a dynamic programing algorithm and a recursive algorithm. The programs work with two variables n which is the number of items, and W the capacity of the bag to put the items in. Note that each item has a different value and weight associated with it. The goal of the algorithms is to find the set of items with the maximum total value, and whose weight is less than or equal to the maximum capcity. To run the program run the command `python3 knapsack.py`. </br>
