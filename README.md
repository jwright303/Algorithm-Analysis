# Algorithm-Analysis
These are programs that I wrote for my analysis of algorithms class. Some of the topics that are covered are recursion, and dynamic programming as well complexity of each.

### Knapsack: Dynamic Programming and Recursion
The knapsack assignment focused on the time and outcome difference between a dynamic programing algorithm and a recursive algorithm. The programs work with two variables n which is the number of items, and W the capacity of the bag to put the items in. Note that each item has a different value and weight associated with it. The goal of the algorithms is to find the set of items with the maximum total value, and whose weight is less than or equal to the maximum capcity. To run the program run the command `python3 knapsack.py`. </br>

This assignment also includes another dynamic programming problem called `shopping.py`. This problem is a similar one to before where a family of n members is trying to maximize the value of items they can get from the store. Each member has a maximum carrying capacity, and can only take one of each item. This program reads from a text file called `shopping.txt` which has a very specific format (required by the assignment which can be seen below). </br>

As output, the program creates a file called results.txt which includes, for each test case, the total value of the items taken by the family, as well as the index of the item that each family member should take to maximize the value. </br>
